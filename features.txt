- Dungeon floors; procedural dungeon that regenerates each floor
- Floor progression; stepping on the trapdoor (T) descends and increments the floor number
- Room count scaling; number of rooms per floor is floor + 2
- Start room; player spawns in an anchored start room near consistent coordinates
- Boss room; the room farthest from the start is marked as the boss room
- Trapdoor (T); placed at the center of the boss room and used to descend

- ASCII map rendering; the dungeon is displayed as a character grid centered on the player
- Sight; full-info sight radius is 6 tiles, plus an extra 3-tile ring that shows only walls/floors (no enemies/items/traps)
- View size; the rendered view is 19x19 tiles (6+3 radius on each side)
- Tile symbols; @=player, E=enemy, #=wall, .=floor, P=potion, T=trapdoor, ~=visible trap, m=mouse hint
- Auto-fit map font size; the ASCII map font scales to fit the screen/container
- Hidden trap hint; hidden traps look like floor but periodically flash orange

- Movement (tap-to-move); tap a tile on the map to auto-walk to it (pathfinding, step-by-step)
- Menu toggle; center button opens/closes the in-game menu and pauses gameplay

- Menu tabs; Inventory, Status, and Log tabs
- Inventory; picked-up potions appear as buttons you can tap/click to consume
- Status screen; shows HP/max HP, damage, toughness, floor number, and burning status (if active)
- Log system; events are shown as a short-lived live overlay and stored in a history log tab

- Player stats; HP, max HP, damage, toughness, and an inventory of potions
- Toughness damage reduction; incoming damage from enemies and traps is reduced by toughness (minimum 0)

- Melee combat (player); moving into an adjacent enemy attacks it for your damage
- Melee combat (enemy); if an enemy is adjacent it attacks you on its turn
- Death/reset; when HP reaches 0 you die (alert), floor resets to 1, HP is restored, and a new floor is generated (stats persist)

- Enemies; 1–2 enemies spawn in each enemy room and are shown as E on the map
- Enemy types (4 tiers); enemies have different HP/damage/sight values based on floor bracket
- Enemy scaling by floor; tier increases every 10 floors (capped at the strongest tier)
- Enemy turns; enemies act after the player’s move
- Enemy chasing; enemies move toward the player when within their sight range
- Enemy wandering; enemies move randomly when the player is outside their sight range
- Enemy death; enemies are removed when their HP reaches 0
- Potion drops; enemies have a 5% chance to drop a random potion on death

- Potions (loot); potions can spawn in rooms and can be dropped by enemies
- Potion spawn chance; each enemy room has a 5% chance to spawn a potion
- Health Potion; fully heals you and increases your max HP by 1
- Strength Potion; permanently increases your damage by 1
- Toughness Potion; permanently increases your toughness by 1

- Traps; traps are placed inside enemy rooms each floor and trigger when stepped on
- Trap count scaling; number of traps increases with floor (capped at 12)
- Visible traps (~); visible traps are shown as ~ in the trap’s color
- Hidden traps; hidden traps look like normal floor but periodically flash orange
- Trap triggers; stepping onto a trap deals damage reduced by toughness, may apply status, then the trap is removed
- Enemy trap interaction; enemies can also trigger traps (including hidden traps)

- Trap types; fire (damage + burning), poison (damage), spike (damage), shock (damage)
- Burning status effect; burning deals damage each turn for a set number of turns (can affect player and enemies)
- Burning stacking; reapplying burning keeps the higher remaining turns and higher damage-per-turn

- Hidden room (secret); floor 1 always (and ~10% chance on later floors) generates a hidden hallway/room behind a false wall
- False-wall reveal; hidden area tiles render as walls until you walk into the entrance false wall to reveal the passage
- Hidden room contents; exactly 1 potion (Health Potion on floor 1, otherwise random) and exactly 1 hidden trap (no enemies)
- Mouse hint (m); a small mouse wanders and, if you get close before the secret is revealed, runs toward the false wall and briefly “pulses” the entrance when it escapes
